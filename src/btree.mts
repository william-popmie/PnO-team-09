/*

This file provides an outline and test suite for an implementation of a 2-3-tree algorithm. Completing this algorithm is a
good way to bootstrap your B-tree implementation. (A 2-3-tree is a special case of a B-tree.)

Note: this outline and test suite is for an implementation where the values in the interior nodes are duplicates of values
that also appear in leaf nodes. It therefore corresponds to a B+-tree rather than a B-tree. For this project, you may choose
to implement either a B-tree or a B+-tree (or any other data structure that offers the specified performance). In the material
we provide, we often use "B-tree" and "B+-tree" interchangeably. Both are perfectly balanced trees with a variable number of
children per interior node.
